# ROS 2

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn’t.

This site contains the documentation for ROS 2. If you are looking for ROS 1 documentation, check out the [ROS wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/).


## Installation
Options for installing ROS 2 Iron Irwin:

Binary packages[](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation.html#binary-packages)
Binaries are only created for the Tier 1 operating systems listed in [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#rolling-ridley-june-2020-ongoing). Given the nature of Rolling, this list may be updated at any time. If you are not running any of the following operating systems you may need to build from source or use a [container solution](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/How-To-Guides/Run-2-nodes-in-single-or-separate-docker-containers.html) to run ROS 2 on your platform.
